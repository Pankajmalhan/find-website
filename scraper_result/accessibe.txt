Summarized Text:
AccessiBe is a company that aims to make the internet accessible to everyone,
 including people with disabilities, believing that accessibility is a crucial
  culture shift for an inclusive society. The company has achieved significant milestones,
   including 200+ employees, 15,079 partners, and 247,778 websites, with over 1.3 billion 
   daily loads. The web accessibility gap is a significant problem, with over 200 million
    active websites inaccessible to people with disabilities, mainly due to small businesses
     lacking access to their code and enterprises lacking education on implementing accessibility.
      To address this, accessiBe is developing technological solutions,
       leveraging AI-driven solutions to drive a real accessibility revolution.
        The company has a strong leadership team and a group of individuals with
         disabilities, known as "The Unstoppables", who are working together
          to raise awareness for disability, accessibility, and inclusivity.
           The company offers a free website audit to check for WCAG and ADA 
           compliance and is looking to hire new team members.
