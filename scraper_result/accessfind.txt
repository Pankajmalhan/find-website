Summarized Text:
AccessFind is a nonprofit initiative that aims to bridge the "accessibility gap" on the internet,
 where less than 3% of websites are accessible to people with disabilities. The platform,
  built in collaboration with the disability community, indexes hundreds of thousands
   of accessible websites, providing a solution to the problem of inaccessible search results.
    AccessFind partners with disability-focused organizations and businesses to promote awareness 
    and education about the importance of accessibility, making online presence more inclusive and accessible.
     The platform, currently in its Beta phase, welcomes feedback from the community to make it more useful,
      and users can get involved by adding their favorite websites and reporting any issues with website accessibility.
       With over 230,000 websites listed, AccessFind provides a search index that audits websites
        for accessibility, allowing users to search and get results based on relevance,
         geolocation, and other factors.
